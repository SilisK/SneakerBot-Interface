# SneakerBot - Client Side

## About this project

This is a client-side application made for this API: [https://github.com/samc621/SneakerBot](https://github.com/samc621/SneakerBot).

## Prerequisites

Run `npm install` after cloning this project.

I recommend cloning my own version of the API if you're going to be using the front-end interface-which can be found here: [https://github.com/SilisK/SneakerBot](https://github.com/SilisK/SneakerBot).
